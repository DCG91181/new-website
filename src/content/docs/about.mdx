DEFCON groups are local chapters or communities affiliated with DEFCON, one of the world's largest and most notable hacking conventions. These groups, often referred to as DC groups, are spread globally and serve as platforms for cybersecurity enthusiasts, hackers, professionals, and researchers to come together, share knowledge, collaborate, and discuss various aspects of cybersecurity, hacking, and technology.

Each DEFCON group operates independently and organizes meetings, workshops, presentations, and events focused on cybersecurity topics. These gatherings aim to promote ethical hacking, cybersecurity awareness, skill development, and networking among individuals interested in the field.

Members of DEFCON groups often engage in activities such as Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, hands-on workshops, discussions on emerging threats and vulnerabilities, sharing research findings, and exploring cutting-edge cybersecurity techniques.
